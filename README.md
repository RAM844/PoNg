Pong is a table tennis-themed twitch arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics.  The right player scores a point if the ball hits the left wall.  The left player scores a point if the ball hits the right wall.  If it hits the top or bottom wall then it bounces off. Each player will have a paddle that can be moved up and down to hit back the ball.
